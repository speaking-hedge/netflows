test environment
----------------

test/create_container.sh
- creates test environment based on ubuntu 14.04
- installs apache2, mysql, php5, sshd
- configures services / passwords

mysql: admin / 1234, port 3306
sshd: root / 1234, port 22
apache2: port 80

test/run_container.sh
- starts the container, exports ports of the servics to the local machine
-- lynx localhost
-- ssh root@localhost
-- mysql -h localhost -u admin -p
- some folders (eg. /var/www/html) are exported to test/mapped_folders/
so you can easily exchange files between the container and the host

test/provisioning.sh 
- build the binaries and deploy them alongside with the files from
services/ to the webserver

test/clear_containers.sh
- whipe out all containers and images. use with care!
